Python iOS Template
===================

A template for building Python apps that will run under iOS.

The easiest way to use this project is to not use it at all - at least,
not directly. `Briefcase <https://github.com/pybee/briefcase/>`__ is a
tool that uses this template, rolling it out using data extracted from
your ``setup.py``.

The master branch of this repository has no content; there is an
independent branch for each supported version of Python. The following
Python versions are supported:

* `Python 2.7 <https://github.com/pybee/Python-iOS-template/tree/2.7>`__
* `Python 3.4 <https://github.com/pybee/Python-iOS-template/tree/3.4>`__
* `Python 3.5 <https://github.com/pybee/Python-iOS-template/tree/3.5>`__

See the individual branches for usage instructions.
